## Introduction

Floyd's Algorithm, also known as the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, is a classic algorithm for finding the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. This project provides both a recursive and an iterative implementation of the algorithm, along with performance comparisons.

## Features

- **Recursive Implementation:** The project includes a recursive version of Floyd's Algorithm for educational purposes.
- **Iterative Implementation:** A more efficient iterative version of the algorithm is provided for practical use.
- **Unit Tests:** Unit tests ensure the correctness of the algorithm implementations.
- **Performance Testing:** Compare the performance of the recursive and iterative versions on large graphs.
